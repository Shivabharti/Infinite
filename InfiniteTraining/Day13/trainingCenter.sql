-- MODULE 4
-- 1) What is required to join two tables?
-- To join two tables in SQL, you need a common column, a JOIN keyword (e.g., INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN), and
-- an ON clause specifying the matching condition.

-- 2) What is meant by self-join?
-- A self-join in SQL refers to the act of joining a table to itself, typically using
-- related columns, to retrieve information about relationships or hierarchies within the same table.

-- 3) How do you qualify a column that is existing in two or more tables that are being joined?
-- To qualify a column that exists in two or more tables that are being joined, you should prefix the column name with the table alias or the table name to specify which table the column belongs to.
-- This is necessary to disambiguate the column and avoid ambiguity in your SQL query. Here's how you can do it:

-- 4) What is table alias? Is it stored anywhere?
--  table alias in SQL is a temporary name or shorthand used to represent a table within a SQL query. It allows you to simplify and clarify your SQL queries, especially when you are working with multiple tables, self-joins, or complex queries. Instead of typing out the full table name every time you
-- reference a column in a query, you can use the alias to make your query more concise and readable.

-- 5)What happens when you join two tables without any condition?
-- When you join two tables without any condition, it's like combining every item from the first table with every item from the second table. This can result in a lot of combinations, and the result might not make sense or be useful because there's no rule for how they should be matched. It's like mixing all the ingredients in your kitchen without following a recipe â€“ you might get a mess instead of a delicious dish. To get meaningful results,
-- you usually need to specify how the items in the tables should be matched or related to each other using conditions or rules.
